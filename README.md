# Version infromation

See https://1tech23.github.io/html/changelog.html or just the file changelog.html for more information regarding changes and updates for the assets of this resource.

# Migration

As of 1/09/23, we have migrated back to Github, due to unforeseen errors with running PHP on Heroku. Do not expect PHP to work whilst these resources are hosted on Github. Thanky uou for considering this, and we apologize for any inconvenience that this has caused.

# About

The website and this website's assets have been in production since February 18, 2021. Created by Logan Alldredge. 
This website is designed to provide help to others, allow users access to third-party resources (audio from Archive.org), and includes a plethora of amusing (and fun) resources such as games and cheats. It also provides guides and codes for TI calculator enthusiasts (mostly TI-83 or better calculators)

# SEO search

This website is available on Google and Bing. It can be found, and traffic is, hopefully, drawn to it. Property will (at some point) be drawn to a personal domain once we have enough money to pay for it. Unfortunately, as little to no traffic is seen, it may be quite some time before anyone even cares enough to purchase a domain.

# Domain
We previously had an active domain, but it was too much of a hassle, so we gave up on it for the time being.
